This project involves building a GPT-style language model using PyTorch, focusing on natural language processing (NLP) tasks like text generation. The model uses multi-head self-attention and feedforward layers, typical in transformer architectures. Key features include token and positional embeddings, multiple transformer blocks, and a custom implementation of the forward and generation methods. The code processes text data, encodes it, and then trains the model with cross-entropy loss. Additionally, it generates new text based on learned patterns using a sampling technique.
